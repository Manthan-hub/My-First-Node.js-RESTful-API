## What is REST?
REST is an acronym for Representational State Transfer. It is web standards architecture and HTTP Protocol. The REST architectural style describes six constraints that were originally communicated by Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation and defines the basis of RESTful-style as:

<li>Uniform Interface
<li>Stateless
<li>Cacheable
<li>Client-Server
<li>Layered System
<li>Code on Demand (optional)

RESTful applications use HTTP requests to perform four operations termed as CRUD (C: create, R: read, U: update, and D: delete). Create and/or update is used to post data, get for reading/listing data, and delete to remove data.

## Tools:
<li>Node.js
<li>MongoDB
<li>Text editor (Atom, Sublime, Visual Studio Code, etc)
<li>Postman
